A social networking website that brings together dog owners, who do not have enough time for their dogs, with dog lovers who always wanted a dog friend, but canâ€™t afford one or can only dedicate a limited time to it.

Take a Paws could be used for dog walking, taking care of the dog while the owner is on holiday, finding a dog for therapy or just find new friends who have dogs, all free of charge.
